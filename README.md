# Ride-Sharing-Logistics

üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **ride-sharing and logistics optimization system**. The application involves matching riders with drivers, calculating estimated times of arrival (ETAs), and optimizing routes for efficiency. The system is inspired by real-world platforms like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash.
üöó Application
- Rider-driver matching based on proximity and availability.
- ETA prediction for improved customer experience.
- Dynamic route optimization for minimizing travel time and fuel consumption.
- Scalable logistics solutions for food delivery and goods transportation.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology
- **Graph Algorithms:** Shortest path (Dijkstra, A*), minimum spanning tree, bipartite matching.
- **Predictive Modeling:** ETA prediction using regression, demand forecasting using time-series models.
- **Geospatial Data Processing:** Mapping locations, distance calculations, GPS-based tracking.
- **Optimization Techniques:** Linear programming, heuristics, reinforcement learning for route planning.
üìå Workflow
1. Data Collection (rider requests, driver availability, map data).
2. Rider-Driver Matching (using graph algorithms and priority queues).
3. ETA Prediction (historical trip data, traffic conditions, predictive modeling).
4. Route Optimization (shortest path algorithms, traffic-aware routing).
5. Simulation & Testing (simulate ride requests and measure efficiency).
6. Deployment (scalable backend with APIs for real-time requests).
‚úÖ Expected Outcomes
- Efficient rider-driver matching system.
- Accurate ETA predictions for better customer satisfaction.
- Optimized routes that reduce cost and travel time.
- A scalable logistics solution applicable to ride-sharing and food/goods delivery.
